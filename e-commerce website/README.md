# Eâ€‘commerce Website (Static Demo)

A small static demo of an e-commerce storefront showcasing product listing and a simple cart built with plain JS.

## Features

- Product listing (grid) with images, titles, and prices.
- Add/remove items to a client-side cart.
- Cart summary with subtotal calculation.
- Simple product filters or categories (if implemented).

## Files

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
- (optional) `products.json` or `data.js` for sample product data
