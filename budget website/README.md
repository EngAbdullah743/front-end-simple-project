# Budget Website

**Simple budget tracker** built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Track incomes, expenses, and see your current balance.

## Features

- Add income and expense items with amount and description.
- See a running total for income, expenses and calculated balance.
- Remove items from the list.
- Simple validation for empty fields and non-numeric amounts.

## Files

- `index.html` — entry page and layout
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — logic for adding/removing items and updating totals

## How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Notes & improvements

- Persist data using `localStorage` so entries persist across page reloads.
- Add categories and filtering (monthly, by category).
- Add charts (e.g., small pie chart using Chart.js) for visual breakdown.
- Improve accessibility: keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.
